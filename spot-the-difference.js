/**
 * This question is asked by Google. 
 * You are given two strings, s and t which only consist of lowercase letters. 
 * t is generated by shuffling the letters in s as well as potentially adding an additional random character. 
 * Return the letter that was randomly added to t if it exists, otherwise, return ’  ‘. 
 * Note: You may assume that at most one additional character can be added to t
 * 
 * @param {*} s 
 * @param {*} t 
 * @returns
