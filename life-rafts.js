 * You are given a list of all the passengersâ€™ weights and are informed that a single life raft has a maximum capacity of limit and can hold at most two people.
 * Return the minimum number of life rafts you must take onboard to ensure the safety of all your passengers.
 * Note: You may assume that a the maximum weight of any individual is at most limit.
